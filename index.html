    <h3>Extra Cirriculars that I participate in</h3>
    <p><strong>Varsity Cheer</strong> <br /><br /> I am the first male in my school's history to be on the cheer team. This was a huge accomplishment for me, as it allowed me to be a role-model to any young children who feel they can't do what they are passionate about because it isn't "normal" to people. This is one of my most courageous endeavors. 
      <br /><br /><strong>Vice President of SGA</strong> <br /><br /> I have been involved in student government since middle school. During the middle school student government, I held positions of leadership such as Senator during 6th grade, Vice President during 7th grade, and President during 8th grade. When I started high school and joined the high school student government, I was class representative up until the end of 11th grade. This year, I was elected Vice President of the Student Government Association. I enjoy participating in this extracurricular because it allows me to exercise my leadership skills and also gives me a chance to be involved in the school's life including school events, student concerns, faculty conversations, and the overall culture of the high school. <br /><br />
